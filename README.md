Contact Author: Kecong Tang (kecong.tang@ucf.edu)

HP-PBWT is a tool to parallel Durbin's PBWT's all vs all L-Long Matches and Set-Maximal Matches by dividing the haplotype dimension. More detailed information will be provided later.

Durbin's PBWT can be found at https://github.com/richarddurbin/pbwt.

Source Code files for general purposes can be found in source_IO_Included/ 

Source Code files for IO-Excluded bencharmk can be found in source_IO_Excluded/

3. Build:
 
   a. Create a directory (E.g. HP-PBWT).
   
   b. Download all the files from the source directory (source_IO_Included/ or source_IO_Excluded/) to the directory created in a.
   
   c. Run "dotnet build --configuration Release" in the directory
   
4. Run:
   
   The compiled executable file should be /bin/Release/net8.0/HP-PBWT
